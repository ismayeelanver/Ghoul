# welcome to ghoul
# this is your first ghoul program
# hello world as always
# let's dive into it.

fun main(args []str) {
    # this is the main function where all the stuff for all ghoul programs runs,
    # here we call the `println` function which is the function for printing a value and then adding a newline to the value we are showing.

    println("Hello, world!")
}

# this is a comment btw :)
